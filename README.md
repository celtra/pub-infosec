# Celtra InfoSec - Public
Welcome to Celtra Inc. InfoSec public repository.

Let us greet you with some little thought: "Passwords are like underwear: you don't let people see it and you don't share it with others."

However, security is a public good. You don't get as much of it if you try to only protect yourself as you do if you work to protect the whole community and others do the same. 

## Security at Celtra

Security is very important at Celtra. We are committed to providing you with policies and guidelines for safeguarding our assets and information. Every employee has an obligation to follow these policies and practice good security common sense.


All the guidelines and policies are available trough Celtra Employee Handbook. If you have further questions on specific policies and procedures provided in the following sections, please reach out to our InfoSec Team.
